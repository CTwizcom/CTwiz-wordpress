Adds new feeds that allow you to export your real estate listings to CTwiz.com

== Description ==

Adds new feeds that allow you to export your real estate listings to CTwiz.com
`http://example.com/feed/ctwiz` or `http://example.com/?feed=ctwiz`

Edit the config.ini file to fine-tune the exported fields. Every Wordpress template is a different and most of the fields are just text fields that differ in each language.
Please consider contributing you config file so we can be compatible with more real estate themes.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `ctwiz-feed` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Check out the feed at http://yourdomain/?feed=ctwiz
4. Fine tune the config.ini file
